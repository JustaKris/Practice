I am applying for a Data Scientist. The company works on Image recognition with Tensorflow.
Can you act as a technical interviewer and conduct a technical Data Science interview for me?
Please ask questions one by one. When I answer, give me feedback if my answer is correct or not (on the scale 1 to 10).
Ask me 20 questions total, staring from very simple to more and more complex.
